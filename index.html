  <h1>Hello, World</h1>
  <p>
    What this page is about: 
    <br>My name is Tri Kurniawan Wijaya and below are notes on papers I published during my PhD 
    on the topic of demand response and smart grid analytics. Hopefully useful for you if you work in the same area.
    <br>Note: I am currently working for Huawei Research on the topic of Recommender Systems and Deep Learning.
