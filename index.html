  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Tri Kurniawan Wijaya and below are notes and resources on papers I published during my PhD 
    on the topic of demand response and smart grid analytics. 
    Hopefully useful for you if you work in the same area.
    <br>
    <br>I am currently working for Huawei Research on the topic of Recommender Systems and Deep Learning.
